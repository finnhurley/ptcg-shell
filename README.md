# ptcg-shell (UNFINISHED)
Pokemon Trading Card Game simulator that runs in the shell, because actual pokemon cards are way too expensive to justify the purchase.

Very unfinished and still working on it, but wanted to make it public for people/friends to play around with and test. See current known bugs and planned features sections to see what currently isn't available

This runs a simulation of the pokemon trading card game using the 2 decks included in the ex battle stadium box from 2004:

(Note: Currently only the blaziken deck is available to be used)

## How to Run
For now, the entry point into the game is via main.py, but will be looking to change that in the future

## Current known bugs
(please feel free to have a play around and let me know if you find anything else!)
- pokemon with secondary attacks can't select them
- pokemon 

## Planned features
